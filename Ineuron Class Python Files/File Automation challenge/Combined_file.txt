----------------- Programming_Assignment1(Advanced) ------------------

1. Write a function that takes a list of lists and returns the value of all of the symbols in it, where each symbol adds or takes something from the total score. Symbol values:

# = 5
O = 3
X = 1
! = -1
!! = -3
!!! = -5

A list of lists containing 2 #s, a O, and a !!! would equal (0 + 5 + 5 + 3 - 5) 8.

If the final score is negative, return 0 (e.g. 3 #s, 3 !!s, 2 !!!s and a X would be (0 + 5 + 5 + 5 - 3 - 3 - 3 - 5 - 5 + 1) -3, so return 0.

Examples

check_score([
  ["#", "!"],
  ["!!", "X"]
]) ➞ 2

check_score([
  ["!!!", "O", "!"],
  ["X", "#", "!!!"],
  ["!!", "X", "O"]
]) ➞ 0

2. Create a function that takes a variable number of arguments, each argument representing the number of items in a group, and returns the number of permutations (combinations) of items that you could get by taking one item from each group.

encode_morse("HELP ME !") ➞ ".... . .-.. .--.   -- .   -.-.--"

This dictionary can be used for coding:

char_to_dots = {
  'A': '.-', 'B': '-...', 'C': '-.-.', 'D': '-..', 'E': '.', 'F': '..-.',
  'G': '--.', 'H': '....', 'I': '..', 'J': '.---', 'K': '-.-', 'L': '.-..',

  'S': '...', 'T': '-', 'U': '..-', 'V': '...-', 'W': '.--', 'X': '-..-',
  'Y': '-.--', 'Z': '--..', ' ': ' ', '0': '-----',
  '1': '.----', '2': '..---', '3': '...--', '4': '....-', '5': '.....',
  '6': '-....', '7': '--...', '8': '---..', '9': '----.',
  '&': '.-...', "'": '.----.', '@': '.--.-.', ')': '-.--.-', '(': '-.--.',

}

    3. Convert the represented positions to boolean values, 1 for True and 0 for False.
    4. Store the conversions into an array.

 Examples

to_boolean_list("deep") ➞ [False, True, True, False]
# deep converts to 0110
# d is the 4th alphabet - 0
# e is the 5th alphabet - 1
# e is the 5th alphabet - 1
# p is the 16th alphabet - 0

i => 2
o => 2
u => 3

# "1lpp0"

Step 3: Add "aca" to the end of the word: "1lpp0aca"

Output: "1lpp0aca"

Examples

encrypt("banana") ➞ "0n0n0baca"

1. Create a function to perform basic arithmetic operations that includes addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on a string number (e.g. "12 + 24" or "23 - 21" or "12 // 12" or "12 * 21").

Here, we have 1 followed by a space, operator followed by another space and 2. For the challenge, we are going to have only two numbers between 1 valid operator. The return value should be a number.

eval() is not allowed. In case of division, whenever the second number equals "0" return -1.

For example:

"15 // 0"  ➞ -1

Examples

arithmetic_operation("12 + 12") ➞ 24 // 12 + 12 = 24

arithmetic_operation("12 - 12") ➞ 24 // 12 - 12 = 0

arithmetic_operation("12 * 12") ➞ 144 // 12 * 12 = 144

arithmetic_operation("12 // 0") ➞ -1 // 12 / 0 = -1

[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Create a function that takes a skyline (2-D list of 0's and 1's) and returns the height of the tallest skyscraper.

  [1, 1, 1, 1]
]) ➞ 2

4. A financial institution provides professional services to banks and claims charges from the customers based on the number of man-days provided. Internally, it has set a scheme to motivate and reward staff to meet and exceed targeted billable utilization and revenues by paying a bonus for each day claimed from customers in excess of a threshold target.

This quarterly scheme is calculated with a threshold target of 32 days per quarter, and the incentive payment for each billable day in excess of such threshold target is shown as follows:

Days	                             Bonus
0 to 32 days	                   Zero
33 to 40 days	         SGD$325 per billable day
41 to 48 days	         SGD$550 per billable day
Greater than 48 days      SGD$600 per billable day

Please note that incentive payment is calculated progressively. As an example, if an employee reached total billable days of 45 in a quarter, his/her incentive payment is computed as follows:

32*0 + 8*325 + 5*550 = 5350

Write a function to read the billable days of an employee and return the bonus he/she has obtained in that quarter.

Examples

bonus(15) ➞ 0

bonus(37) ➞ 1625

bonus(50) ➞ 8200

is_disarium(135) ➞ True
# 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135

is_disarium(544) ➞ False

is_disarium(518) ➞ True

is_disarium(466) ➞ False

is_disarium(8) ➞ True

----------------- Programming_Assignment4(Advanced) ------------------
